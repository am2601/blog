    The short answer is Yes, computers existed a long time ago.<br>In fact, the first computer that we know about was created
    by ancient Greeks more than 2 thousand years ago.
    To understand what I am talking about - let's dive deeper into the topic and define what computers are. You’re probably
    imagining something with a screen, keyboard, and mouse. This is a digital computer - it uses zeros and ones to process
    information. On the other hand, there are analog computers that mostly use mechanical principles and are usually
    designed to do specific tasks. This type existed before digital computers were invented. And the oldest analog computer
    that has been found so far - the
    <a target="_blank" class="text-indigo-500 hover:underline" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antikythera_mechanism">Antikythera mechanism</a>.
    It was created by ancient Greeks approximately in the late second or the early first century BC.

    In 1901, the shipwreck was discovered near the island of Antikythera in Greece. Among bronze statues, glassware, and
    jewelry, divers also found a mysterious mechanism. It contained gears, but scientists for a long time couldn’t
    understand what this mechanism did.
    After X-ray technology appeared, the item was scanned and it turned out that the device was a model of the solar system.
    The mechanism tracked a movement cycle of objects in space and could show in what position the sun, moon, and planets
    would be. Scientists were able to identify 82 parts of the mechanism, 37 of which were bronze gears of different
    diameters.
    The user could scroll the main lever, which was responsible for the movement of time, and see the exact position of all
    space objects known by ancient Greeks.
    Сreating such a thing was a very difficult job that required exceptional skill in the production of gears as well as
    serious knowledge of astronomy. Mechanisms with similar capabilities were not invented again until the 14th century. The
    main purpose of the device is still unclear - it could have been used to confirm theories about space or to keep track
    of some important events, such as the Olympic Games.

    It’s hard to imagine that this could have been created by one person; most likely, a whole team of developers worked on
    the project. Manufacturing required a strong knowledge of the cosmos as well as complex mathematical calculations to
    accurately simulate the speed and orbit of space objects.
    But the most interesting thing is that the mechanism also contained a user manual for the device. Which, to be honest,
    not all developers do even now.
    The complexity of the mechanism and the technologies used for production suggests that this is most likely not the first
    such mechanism made at that time. Probably ancient people invented many more complex computing devices. There is a small
    chance that in the future people will find other mechanisms, but most likely the majority of them are simply destroyed
    by corrosion of metal.
