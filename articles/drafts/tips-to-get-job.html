    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">1. Add keywords from job description to your CV</h2>
    <p class="pt-3">
        Big corporations often use management systems for sorting candidates, since there may be too many job
        applications. In
        most cases, such automatic systems look for keywords in the text of the resume and compare them with
        those required for
        the vacancy. Make sure you add all required hard and soft skills from the vacancy to your resume,
        otherwise it may never
        be seen by a real person.
    </p>
</section>
<section id="2" class="pt-10">
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">2. Use measurable metrics to describe your work experience or projects</h2>
    <p class="pt-3">
        Instead of just describing what you’re been doing in your previous jobs - write about your
        accomplishments. Company hire
        people to provide value to their business. So in order to get a job you need to show that you are able
        to provide that
        value and did it before. Nobody would care that you’ve been <i>“redesigning a web page”</i>, you need to show
        the result of
        your work, not a process.<br>
        <i>“Increased the average number of purchases per month by redesigning a web page”</i> would be a much stronger
        point. Also
        keep in mind that without measurable metrics it’s just a couple of fancy words. You need to provide
        numbers in order to
        show your accomplishments. For example instead of just:<br>
        ❌ “Increased the average number of purchases per month by redesigning a web page”<br>
        use<br>
        ✅ “Increased the average number of purchases <span class="underline">by 30%</span> per month by redesigning a web page”

<section id="3" class="pt-10">
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">3. Make resume fit job opportunity</h2>
    <p class="pt-3">
        Before sending a resume carefully read the job description and change the resume to meet requirements
        from there. You obviously should not lie about skills if you don’t have them, but you can reorder skills
        listing depending on how they are listed in the job description. Also always use the same title on your
        resume as the position you are applying for.
        If you don’t have time to make a unique copy of your resume for every position - you can at least make a
        couple of different copies with minor changes and then for each position just send a resume that better
        fits.
    </p>

<section id="4" class="pt-10">
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">4. Structure your resume correctly, keep it short, clear and readable</h2>
    <p class="pt-3">
        Recruiter should be able to get all necessary information about you from resume in a minimum amount of time. The person
        who reads your resume most likely has a bunch of resumes to check next to yours, so he(she) definitely won’t waste time
        on poorly written ones.
        Start from a short and clear summary, then place your skills, after that should come work experience or projects,
        education and any other info should be at the very end, because it is less important.
        Keep your resume short, in most cases it should fit in one page. Follow general rules for document formatting to make it
        easy to read. Good idea is to use templates with prepared structure and formatting. My favorite service for that is
        <a target="_blank" class="text-indigo-500 hover:underline" href="https://resume.io/">resume.io</a>.
    </p>
</section>
<section id="5" class="pt-10">
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">5. Get additional “side” skills</h2>
    <p class="pt-3">
        If you see that most positions in your field have listed a certain skill - you can get this skill, for example, by
        taking a short basic level course and paste it into resume.
        In many web developer vacancies you can now see that knowledge of cloud computing services will be a plus for the
        candidate. Even if you've never had such experience, you can spend a few hours taking a course on AWS, for example, and
        put it on your resume, which can help you get an interview. When you get a job, you can always quickly master a specific
        skill.
        Obviously, you shouldn't lie - if the skill is in main requirements, then such a trick probably will not help. To do
        this, you must know your field and understand which skills are critical and which are optional.

<section id="6" class="pt-10">
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">6. Check grammar in your resume</h2>
    <p class="pt-3">
        This may seem obvious - but always check the grammar on your resume and cover letter. Obvious mistakes in words tell the
        recruiter about your inattention and frivolous attitude, since you did not even check the mistakes before sending. Now
        there are AI tools for this, for example <a target="_blank" class="text-indigo-500 hover:underline" href="https://grammarly.com/">Grammarly</a>, you just need to insert your text there and the service will
        automatically highlight mistakes and offer correction options.

<section id="7" class="pt-10">
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">7. Clean up your GitHub</h2>
    <p class="pt-3">
        Keep public only the best projects that can demonstrate your current skills. It is better to hide weak or unfinished
        projects that do not correspond to your current level. Try to write a short and clear description for each of the
        projects in the Readme file. Also review the code and update old projects.
        If you are not looking for your first job and there are no new projects on your Github that could demonstrate your
        skills and increase your value, it is better not to add it to your resume. Remember that Github can not only increase
        your chances, but also reduce them if it is poorly designed.
    </p>
</section>
<section id="8" class="pt-10">
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">8. Use email that contains your name for communication</h2>
    <p class="pt-3">
        To communicate during your job search, use an email that contains your name. Avoid usage of gaming or joke emails,
        people will not take seriously the resume received from <span class="text-indigo-500">superminecraftplayer123@gmail.com</span>.
    </p>
</section>
<section id="9" class="pt-10">
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">9. Clean up networks that you linking in resume</h2>
    <p class="pt-3">
        You should make sure that you look professional on social media. It’s better not to leave links to social networks in
        your resume, where you post mainly photographs of a personal nature, for example, photos from vacations, parties, fun
        with friends.
    </p>
</section>
<section id="10" class="pt-10">
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">10. Get quality photos in formal style for your profile</h2>
    <p class="pt-3">
        Set quality photo in formal style as profile picture for linkedin, gmail and other services you are going to use for
        communication during job seeking. Your profile photo has a major impact on the first impression of you. If you don’t
        have appropriate photos - it's a good idea to do 1 photo session with a professional and then use these photos wherever
        needed.
    </p>
</section>
<section id="11" class="pt-10">
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">11. Fill your Linkedin profile to get job offers without applying</h2>
    <p class="pt-3">
        Place information from your resume into your Linkedin profile and in settings check that you are seeking for a job.
        Recruiters often seek candidates through Linkedin search by job title. So make sure that your header includes the job
        title. It may help you passively receive offers without submitting applications, which is always good. Your Linkedin
        profile should contain more general information about you as a professional, while resume should be tailored for a
        concrete position based on job description, where you’re applying.
    </p>
</section>
<section id="12" class="pt-10">
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">12. Upload your resume to other resources where recruiters seek for employees</h2>
    <p class="pt-3">
        Getting invitations for an interview without doing nothing never hurts. You can use services like
        <a target="_blank" class="text-indigo-500 hover:underline" href="https://www.indeed.com/">Indeed</a>,
        <a target="_blank" class="text-indigo-500 hover:underline" href="https://www.dice.com/">Dice</a>,
        <a target="_blank" class="text-indigo-500 hover:underline" href="https://www.careerbuilder.com/">CareerBuilder</a>,
        <a target="_blank" class="text-indigo-500 hover:underline" href="https://www.monster.com/">Monster</a>,
        and others to upload your resume and maybe you get lucky.

<section id="13" class="pt-10">
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">13. Try to send your resume directly to recruiter</h2>
    <p class="pt-3">
        You can try to send your resume directly to the recruiter or team manager, if you manage to find their email or Linkedin
        profile. Make your message personal and it actually may work better than applying through website like hundreds of other
        candidates.
    </p>
</section>
<section id="14" class="pt-10">
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">14. Reach to people from company where you want to get a job</h2>
    <p class="pt-3">
        Try to reach employees who work in similar positions in the company you want to work for, you can introduce yourself and
        ask for help. Big companies often have referral bonus and you both can get profit if employee refer you. Even if not,
        people from inside can share some tips or get you in touch with the recruiter or team manager directly. You’ll be
        surprised how many people want to help if you ask them. Of course, for that, you need some communication skills, which
        is not that easy, but the result is worth trying.

<section id="15" class="pt-10">
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">15. Prepare for a problem solving on Leetcode</h2>
    <p class="pt-3">
        In many companies, one part of a technical interview will be solving a programming problem. You shouldn’t pay too much
        attention to this, but it’s a good idea to solve at least a couple of problems on the
        <a target="_blank" class="text-indigo-500 hover:underline" href="https://leetcode.com/">Leetcode</a>
        to understand what to expect during the interview.

</section>
<section id="16" class="pt-10">
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">16. Think out loud during a technical interview</h2>
    <p class="pt-3">
        The ability to think logically and find solutions in complex situations is one of the most important skills of a
        developer and is valued more than just knowledge of a certain algorithm or instructions that can always be viewed on the
        Internet. If during an interview you don’t know how to solve a problem or don’t remember the exact answer to a question,
        try thinking out loud and making a guess. In most cases it’ll give you some points for question, because interviewer
        want to see the ability to solve problems, and not just memorized answers.
    </p>

<section id="17" class="pt-10">
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">17. Prepare a good microphone and camera</h2>
    <p class="pt-3">
        The first rounds of interviews are now almost always conducted online. Make sure your audio and video are of acceptable
        quality. Bad sound is annoying and can subconsciously affect people's impressions of you. A good microphone and camera
        are cheap these days - buy and set them up before the interview. Great options from Amazon:

    <p class="pt-3">
        Again - you want to make the best possible impression on the person interviewing you to increase your chances. A mess in
        a room in the background or dirty clothes may negatively affect this, so take care of your background and appearance
        before going to an online interview.
