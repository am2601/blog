<h1 class="text-3xl font-bold pb-3">About</h1>
<p>
Welcome to the blog about programming (which is obviously from the name).
I work as a programmer and this blog is just a way to take my mind off my problems and have a little fun. Here are some
interesting stories and facts about programming that I hope you can enjoy too. There were also tutorials (how to is the
most frequently used word among programmers). I'm too lazy to write a long description, and you'd better spend your time
on something more exciting.
